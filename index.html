        <p class="heading">Here is how to Invest and make up to 350% Return on your Investment</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you invest a Certain amount, you will be given the equivalent of that amount in products. When someone close to your location needs that product, they will make payment into the company’s account and visit you to collect the product (making you a stockiest for PURE products). 
        One thing I know for a fact is that 80% of Nigerians will be buying these products soon because these products do work and they will be getting it from you, that more money for you.
        350% return on you Investment will be returned gradually till the end of your investment which could be between 2-3 months.
